# Day 3 - Drawing Marbles

### Objective 

In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.

### Task 

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

### Answer

First there are total 7 marbles (3R and 4B). The probability of chosing red marble first is 3/7.
After chosing the first one, we have to chose second one. If the first marble was not replaced, there are 6 marbles total (2R and 4B). Now probability of getting a blue marble out of these is 4/6 = 2/3
