# Day 3 - Conditional Probability

### Objective 

In this challenge, we get started with conditional probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

### Task 

Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

### Answer

We know that at least one child is a boy, so we have 3 possible results:
(B, B), (B, G), (G, B)
Total results will be: 3
Therefore probability will be = 1/3
