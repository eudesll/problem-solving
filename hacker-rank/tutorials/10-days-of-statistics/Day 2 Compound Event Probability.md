# Day 2 - Compound Event Probability

### Objective 

In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge. 

### Task 

There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z. 

- Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
- Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
- Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

### Answer

A = Chance of urn X dran a black ball = 3/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 60/504
B = Chance of urn Y dran a black ball = 4/7 * 4/9 * 4/8 = 64/504
C = Chance of urn Z dran a black ball = 4/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 80/504

P(A) v P(B) v P(C) = 60/504 + 64/504 + 80/504 = 204/504 => 204/504 % 12 => 17/42
