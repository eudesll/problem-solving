# Day 2 - More Dice

### Objective 

In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. We recommend you review the previous challenge's Tutorial before attempting this problem. 

### Task 

In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

### Answer

There will be only 4 possible results:
(1,5) , (5,1) , (2,4) , (4,2)
Total results will be: 6*6 = 36
Therefore probability will be = 4/36 = 1/9
